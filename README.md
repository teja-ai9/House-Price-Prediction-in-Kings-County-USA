# House-Price-Prediction-in-Kings-County-USA
Dataset that records the house prices of 9,761 houses in King County, Washington, US. The house prices are recorded along with some other attributes like - area of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. The assay of the project is:

1) Question the data - Understanding the variables very carefully and formulate questions/hypothesis. (Note that these are just initial hypothesis which may or may not seem to be true after the EDA step).

2) EDA - Univariate analysis and bivariate analysis by choosing appropriate graphs, charts and descriptive measures. 

3) Feature engineering - (A) Feature transformations (like log(X), sqrt(X), X^2, X1*X2, etc.) 
  (B) New feature generation techniques (e.g., creating dummy variables, using one-hot encoding, or transforming an existing feature to a new feature as you may convert the variable.  
4) Model fitting step: A decision tree model can be used to fit the data mode accurately. 
5) Model testing - Considering the best competing models and test their performances on the test data. Reporting the results.
